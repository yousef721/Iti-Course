    1) Preprocessing only:
        gcc -E Lap-10.1.c -o out.i
        ğŸ”¹ Runs only the **preprocessor** stage.
        ğŸ”¹ Expands #include, replaces macros, removes comments.
        ğŸ”¹ Output is saved in "out.i".

/*
    2) Compilation to Assembly:
        gcc -S Lap-10.1.c -o out.asm
        ğŸ”¹ Runs the **compiler** stage (after preprocessing).
        ğŸ”¹ Translates the C code into Assembly language.
        ğŸ”¹ Output is saved in "out.asm".

        ğŸ‘‰ This lets you see the low-level assembly instructions
        generated from your C code, but it does not yet create
        an object file or executable.

/*
    3) Assembly to Object file:
        gcc -c Lap-10.1.c -o out.o
        ğŸ”¹ Runs the **assembler** stage.
        ğŸ”¹ Converts the assembly code into **machine code**
        stored inside an object file (.o).
        ğŸ”¹ Output is "out.o".

        ğŸ‘‰ At this point, it's machine code but not executable yet
        because no linking has been done.

/*
    4) Linking:
        gcc Lap-10.1.c -o out.exe
        ğŸ”¹ Runs the **full pipeline**: preprocessing â†’ compiling
        â†’ assembling â†’ linking.
        ğŸ”¹ Produces a final executable file: "out.exe".

        ğŸ‘‰ This is the file you can run directly.
